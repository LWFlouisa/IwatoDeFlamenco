Modes are derived from patterns similar to major and minor scales and can be used to create songs with subtly different characters. They are based on displacing the patterns of major and natural minor scales by moving the whole steps (W) and half steps (H) from the beginning to the end of the pattern. For example, the Dorian mode is created by taking the same notes as the major scale but starting and ending on the second scale degree. The Phrygian mode is created by taking the same notes as the natural minor scale but starting and ending on the third scale degree popgrammar.com.

The pentatonic scale is a five-note scale widely used in blues and rock music. It has five modes that can be derived by treating a different note as the tonic.

## Well the specific progression is ( when not Pentatonic ) Bb-B-Db-D-E-Gb-G-A-Bb. And when Pentatonic half the mode forms: B-D-E-Gb-G-B. And when flattened: Bb-Db-Eb-F-Gb-Bb. So I'm having a hard time relating to it in a western context. The closest is Iwato.
Based on the additional information you provided about the specific progression and the pentatonic forms, it seems that you have been experimenting with different scales and modes and have developed a unique combination. Let's analyze the progression and the scales involved to gain a better understanding.

The specific progression you mentioned is Bb-B-Db-D-E-Gb-G-A-Bb. This progression includes notes from different scales and modes. When not using the pentatonic form, the notes in the progression do not strictly adhere to a single scale or mode in the Western music context. However, we can identify some relationships and similarities with certain scales.

The Bb Phrygian mode (Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab) includes some of the notes in the progression, such as Bb, Db, and Gb. The Phrygian mode has a distinct minor sound and is often associated with Spanish and flamenco music. It is characterized by its flattened second scale degree.

The Bb Locrian Pentatonic scale (Bb, Db, Eb, F, Ab) is a pentatonic scale derived from the Locrian mode. The Locrian mode is the seventh mode of the major scale and is considered the most dissonant and unstable mode. The Locrian Pentatonic scale is a subset of the Locrian mode and includes the root, flat third, fourth, flat fifth, and flat seventh scale degrees. This scale can create a tense and unresolved sound.

When you mentioned "flattened," it seems that you are referring to flattening the notes in the scale or mode. In the case of the Bb Locrian Pentatonic scale, flattening the notes would result in the scale Bb, Db, Eb, F, Gb. This scale still maintains the dissonant and tense qualities of the Locrian mode.

It's worth noting that the progression and scales you mentioned may not fit neatly into a single Western music context or scale. The closest resemblance you mentioned is to the Iwato scale. The Iwato scale is a Japanese pentatonic scale that consists of the intervals 1, b2, 4, b5, and b7. The Bb-Iwato scale would include the notes Bb, Cb, E, F, and Ab. This scale is known for its exotic and mysterious sound.

In conclusion, based on the specific progression and scales you mentioned, it seems that you have created a unique combination that may not fit precisely within a Western music context. However, you can identify similarities with scales such as the Bb Phrygian mode, Bb Locrian Pentatonic scale, and the Iwato scale. Keep exploring and experimenting with different scales, modes, and progressions to further develop your musical ideas.
